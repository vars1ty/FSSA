# FSSA
## What is FSSA?
**F**ederal **S**SO **S**ecurity **A**Gency is a Star Stable Online modding utility, aiming to make the game less boring.

## What differs in comparison to SSOUtils?
SSOUtils was intended to be private at first, hence having tons and tons of overly op features, and no restrictions at all on what scripts users could use.

FSSA was closed-sourced after users started to abuse certain functions in it, and a pedophile skidded the code because he's a C# script-kiddie.

While being closed-source, tons of code was locked away from your average Barbie horse-girl Reddit keyboard-warrior to try and make it fair for everyone, but since it's nearly impossible to make modding a client-only experience, it's now open again.

FSSA **only** offer .CSA (Cold Storage Archive) patches, and not memory patching at the moment (and probably never will).

## Is it against the TOS?
Yes, it is against the Terms of Service and you use it **at your own risk**.

## But now Florian Lehmann can steal it again
Being older than 22, struggling with C# and failing with modifying raw .CSA files is his problem, not mine.

He'll get locked up eventually, just give it time :^).

## Are PRs welcome?
Yeah, just give a proper description on what your change(s) are and why you want them implemented.
